# PolyGod Android App

This app can be used to support jamming over LAN with the [PolyJam App](https://www.github.com/tkirshboim/polyjam).
PolyGod moderates the jam session, so the use case is one device running PolyGod and at least 1 device (but probably more) running the PolyJam app.
Sounds are produced on a separate computer that receives OSC messages from the jam participants.

This app was created as part of a collaboration between [Polyjam](http://www.polyjam.de) and Tal Kirshboim.
It originally created for a Polyjam event that took place in Berlin on March 2015.

**Note:** While the app is useable, it is in an experimetal state (alpha version). Please see the [license](LICENSE.txt).
